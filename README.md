# AI Design Skills

Structured skills for AI design workflows—planning, research, exploration, refinement, handoff, QA, design system, and continuous improvement.

## Structure

Skills live in `.claude/skills/` and follow **verb–noun** naming. Categories:

1. **Planning** — gather context, audit design system, decompose requirements, identify dependencies & risks, draft acceptance criteria, generate user stories  
2. **Research** — analyze competitors, identify assumptions, audit current UX, generate insights, generate opportunity solution trees, synthesize user feedback  
3. **Exploration** — critique designs, draft copy, explore layouts, generate rapid concepts, match patterns to design system, explore workflows  
4. **Refinement** — check design consistency, generate copy for all states, ideate micro-interactions, identify edge cases, review accessibility, suggest responsive adaptations  
5. **Handoff** — break down dev tasks, document behaviours, extract design tokens, generate component specs, generate Storybook stories, translate design to code  
6. **QA** — analyze visual regressions, audit accessibility, compare design fidelity, generate automated fixes, generate QA checklists, verify edge cases  
7. **Design system** — assess & migrate shadcn updates, audit components & detect redundancy, detect patterns across codebase, generate & maintain documentation, manage design tokens, plan deprecations  
8. **Continuous improvement** — create & refine skills, identify design debt, facilitate retrospectives, improve templates & automation, track & report metrics, analyze workflow patterns  

## Usage

Use with Claude (or compatible agents) that load skills from this directory. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with name, description, allowed tools, and instructions.
